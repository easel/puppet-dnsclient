# Configuration file for /sbin/dhclient. This file is managed by puppet
# as a part of the dnsclient module. It is based on the standard debian
# dhclient.conf, with the exception that it overrides dns servers
#
# This is a sample configuration file for dhclient. See dhclient.conf's
#	man page for more information about the syntax of this file
#	and a more comprehensive list of the parameters understood by
#	dhclient.
#
# Normally, if the DHCP server provides reasonable information and does
#	not leave anything out (like the domain name, for example), then
#	few changes must be made to this file, if any.
